                Your risk of death is more than 12 times higher if you go to a bottom 20% hospital in your area. However, 58% of Americans select a hospital based on driving distance rather than the quality of care. While location matters, choosing the right hospital can be a life-saving decision. Even hospitals staffed by top-tier surgeons can have poor outcomes if they don’t have high quality standards in place.
                
                Imagine you’re able to schedule your joint replacement surgery with the best surgeon in the world. Let’s say this surgeon performs your replacement flawlessly. While this may sound ideal, you could still contract an infection. Perhaps a nurse recorded your medical history inaccurately, a physician’s assistant neglected proper cleaning procedures, or a doctor missed the symptoms of a Staph infection. That’s why the quality of the hospital is as important as the quality of the surgeon.</p>
              <h2>Quality Control Measures</h2>
              <img src="img2.jpg" width="250">
              <p>One of the simplest examples of quality control is handwashing compliance. Unclean hands are a primary source of hospital-acquired infections. Alarmingly, national studies show that practitioners wash their hands nearly half as often as necessary. The majority of American hospitals do not adequately monitor compliance or hold providers accountable when inadequate hand hygiene leads to infections. Studies show that a 48% handwashing compliance rate translates to a 17% chance of a hospital-acquired infection. When you compare this to an equivalent hospital with a 66% compliance rate, the complication rate drops to 10%.

                Up to 1 million patients fall in U.S. hospitals each year, which can lead to significant fractures, cuts, or internal bleeding. The safest hospitals use a 6-factor scale to calculate each patient’s risk of falling, like medications that might cause lower limb weakness. Nurses can then help prevent falls by implementing appropriate interventions, and educating patients and their families on fall prevention strategies. It is crucial for nurses to remain vigilant and take proactive measures to minimize the risk of falls in healthcare settings.</p>
